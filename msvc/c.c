/* 
This is example of mixing C and assembly (using MS Visual C)

this file demonstrates following:
- calling stdcall function defined in asm      (fasm_stdcall_avg)
- calling ccall function defined in asm        (fasm_ccall_avg)
 - accessing data defined in asm                (fasm_string)

compile with:
	cl /c c.c
link with:
	link c.obj asm.obj
